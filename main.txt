Deliver an integrated model risk, valuation, and leveraged-products analytics platform that inventories and validates models (credit/market/liquidity/valuation), powers margin and risk for margin/options/futures books, and supports after-the-fact independent validation workflows; include libraries for valuation (Monte Carlo, binomial/trinomial trees, PDE for exotics, Greeks and AAD), exposure and VaR/ES with heavy-tail and copula options, Bayesian/probabilistic modeling (PyMC/NumPyro) for uncertainty quantification, survival analysis (scikit-survival) for default/hazard modeling, anomaly detection (PyOD/River) for drift and rare-event monitoring, stress testing and scenario engines, and causal/AB testing modules for policy impacts; provide a full-featured CLI (Click + Rich) with menus for model registration and metadata, data lineage audits, challenger/benchmark runs, sensitivity and backtesting, margin policy calibration, stress scenario generation, validation report assembly, and sign-off workflows—all with progress bars, live metrics, and downloadable artifacts; implement an automated test suite (pytest) covering unit tests for pricing kernels, risk metrics, and margin calculators; property-based tests for pricing/risk invariants (monotonicity, put-call parity, positive semi-definiteness), integration tests spanning data→model→risk→report pipelines, regression tests on curated portfolios and stress packs, performance tests on GPU/numba-accelerated paths, and mutation testing, achieving ≥95% coverage with coverage gates in CI; incorporate a model registry (MLflow), feature store (Feast or DuckDB-powered), reproducible datasets (Parquet/Arrow + checksums), explainability (SHAP/feature attribution dashboards), and governance (approval states, audit logs, diffed validation reports); add observability with JSON logs, OpenTelemetry traces, Prometheus metrics (PD/LGD drift, margin shortfalls, validation SLA), and alerting; secure the stack with secrets management, role-based access, and signed artifacts; ship Docker images, GitHub Actions CI/CD with pinned dependencies and SBOMs, style/type enforcement (black, ruff, mypy, pre-commit), and comprehensive documentation including validator playbooks, governance SOPs, and stakeholder-facing reports.
